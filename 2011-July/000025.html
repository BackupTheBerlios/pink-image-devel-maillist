<PRE>Yes, your method for getting it from pink to scipy looks interesting. I
think I cant benefit from it, because I am working (forced to work
actually), so your trick wouldn't be avaiable ...
 
For now anyway, I am happy with scipy getting the image from the buffer
as I work with binary images ...
 
Now, back to numpy to pink:
 
1- I found it's possible to write an image to a file-like object , so
that you don't have to write it to the disk or use a pipe. First use
temp = tempfile.TemporaryFile, and then if you have your image in PIL
format, just saying yourimage.save(temp,'format'), you get it to the
temp. Now the thing would be to use the pink.cpp.readimage to grab the
image from this temporary file, but apparently it only accepts a string
with the name of the file as argument and not an object ... or maybe
there is a way? any idea?
 
2- there is this intriguing class, pink.np. There there is a method
pink.np.frombuffer. If you use this you can get the data from the numpy
array to pink ... but apparently it still is a numpy array. Maybe there
is a way in pink from internally convert this numpy object to a char
image?
 
3- I manage to get the for loops working on cython. It makes the thing a
bit faster, but sill is slower than writing the image to the disk and
then retrieving it, so, no use for it.

	Hi Jerome, 
	 
	your code from pink to scipy works for my images, nice!!!
	 
	now the problem is how to import the images from numpy to pink
...
	 
	I think the problem is the pink image is not just raw data but
is compressed or encoded in some way I don't understand. Therefore, you
need to encode the data first before put it into the pink image (in the
case of your code, the get_pixels method is decoding from the pink to
raw pixel data). I guess without this decoding, the whole thing will
fail. As an example, you can get the buffer data from a numpy array,
just by the buit in method data: mynumpyarray.data. But then, if you try
to write it to the pink image, it fails. 
	 
	So, I think we really need some help from the pink experts for a
function to import from numpy/scipy to pink.


I think so too.
 

	 
	Another option I am thinking, is to first convert the image to
image (scipy.misc.toimage), then, save it as a pgm image
(scipy.misc.imsave), and then load this pgm image into pink
(pink.cpp.readimage). This works, and is about 25 times faster than the
for loops. Of course it's very silly to write an image to the disk each
time you want to do this convertion, 


It is not that silly, maybe just inelegant. If you look in the source
code of ndimage, they do this kind of trick.
 

	and therefore would be nice to save the image in an object or
pipe, and then open it with pink, again from the object or pipe. I don't
know how to do this, and I don't know if it would work.


To speed up things, it might be a good idea to dump the image in the
/dev/shm directory. As far as I understood, it is a directory mounted in
RAM.

Another issue is when you need more than 8 bit. As far as I know, Pink
only read and write PGM and PGM only accept 8 bit. Pink has developped
its own PGM format to be able to handle 16 bit integer or float for
instance. But this pink format is not readable by scipy. The only other
software able to read that is G'mic &lt;<A HREF="http://gmic.sourceforge.net/">http://gmic.sourceforge.net/</A>&gt; ,
which doesn't run under python, it thus has to be used with
subprocess.Popen. 

But still, there are some issues in the way scipy.misc.imsave works: it
modify the data to recreate an 8 bit thing stretched from 0 to 255.

Anyway, at the end, the idea would be from  pink to scipy:

import subprocess
import pink.cpp as pink
import scipy

#create a 32bit int image :
test_image = pink.int_image([50,50])
#to be sure to be out a 8bit range :
test_image[0]=256
test_image.writeimage(&quot;/dev/shm/tmp.pnk&quot;)
subprocess.Popen(&quot;gmic /dev/shm/tmp.pnk -o /dev/shm/tmp.png&quot;,shell=True)

.pnk is the extension name chosen by G'mic as the pink format



	 
	any idea?
	 
	Otto

		Hi Jerome, 
		 
		quite interesting. is your code working? 


	I thought so when I pasted this code in the bug tracker, but
since then I think I found a case that did not work properly. It
probably has to be refined at least. Maybe it works as it is for your
video problems, you are invited to test :)
	 

		maybe we can join efforts to write something ?


	I would sure be interested in the solution, but I don't know
much about computing, I just started python this year. I actually just
copied what is done in the pil_photoimage.py file.
	
	I think I understand the idea behind weave, it is supposed to
accelerate the &quot;code&quot;, I can't help with that high level thing.
	
	Another solution is to go on with the &quot;buffer format&quot; like in
the pink_to_ndimage function I wrote, but I don't know how to transform
a NDimage into a buffer nor how to read a buffer with pink. If someone
has an idea?
	
	Jerome

		Hi,
		
		I don't have time to test your weave, but i already
filed a feature request about that:
	
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?func=detailfeature&amp;feature_id=5360&amp;">http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?func=detailfeature&amp;feature_id=5360&amp;</A>
group_id=12429
		
		with something done about it, but not much:
		
		def pink_to_ndimage(image):
		    if type(image) == pink.char_image:
		        return
	
scipy.frombuffer(image.get_pixels(),'int8').reshape(image.size[1],image.
size[0])
		    elif type(image) == pink.float_image:
		        return
	
scipy.frombuffer(image.get_pixels(),'float32').reshape(image.size[1],ima
ge.size[0])
		    elif type(image) == pink.int_image:
		        return
	
scipy.frombuffer(image.get_pixels(),'int32').reshape(image.size[1],image
.size[0])
		    else :
		        print(&quot;format non-detecte&quot;)

			Hello,
			
			I'm new to pink. I got my images as numpy arrays
(because I'm extracting
			them from videos, and then doing some
pre-processing on open cv and
			scipy-numpy), and would like an efficient way to
convert this numpy
			arrays to pink char images. Laszlo already
pointed me at a solution that
			works, using for loops in python, but it's a bit
slow. Does anyone have
			a solution? Would it be possible to implement
such a feature in pink. If
			yes, the way back to numpy would be necessary as
well.
			
			I was trying also to write it using scipy.weave,
but for some reason it
			fails, any suggestion?
			My code looks like this:
			
			
			#bwtest is the binary image I would like to
convert to pink. Size_x and
			size_y are the x and y dimensions of bwtest.
			
			I=pink.cpp.char_image([size_x,size_y])
			
			code = '''
			       int i;
			       int m;
			
			       for (i=0; i &lt;size_x; ++i){
			           for (m=0; m&lt;size_y;++m){
			
			                I(i,m) = bwtest(m,i);
			            }
			       }
			       '''
			
			err = weave.inline(code,
arg_names=['size_x','size_y','bwtest','I'],
	
type_converters=weave.converters.blitz,
			                  compiler = 'gcc')
			
			Many thanks!
