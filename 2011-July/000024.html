<PRE>Hi Jerome, 
 
your code from pink to scipy works for my images, nice!!!
 
now the problem is how to import the images from numpy to pink ...
 
I think the problem is the pink image is not just raw data but is
compressed or encoded in some way I don't understand. Therefore, you
need to encode the data first before put it into the pink image (in the
case of your code, the get_pixels method is decoding from the pink to
raw pixel data). I guess without this decoding, the whole thing will
fail. As an example, you can get the buffer data from a numpy array,
just by the buit in method data: mynumpyarray.data. But then, if you try
to write it to the pink image, it fails. 
 
So, I think we really need some help from the pink experts for a
function to import from numpy/scipy to pink.
 
Another option I am thinking, is to first convert the image to image
(scipy.misc.toimage), then, save it as a pgm image (scipy.misc.imsave),
and then load this pgm image into pink (pink.cpp.readimage). This works,
and is about 25 times faster than the for loops. Of course it's very
silly to write an image to the disk each time you want to do this
convertion, and therefore would be nice to save the image in an object
or pipe, and then open it with pink, again from the object or pipe. I
don't know how to do this, and I don't know if it would work.
 
any idea?
 
Otto

	Hi Jerome, 
	 
	quite interesting. is your code working? 


I thought so when I pasted this code in the bug tracker, but since then
I think I found a case that did not work properly. It probably has to be
refined at least. Maybe it works as it is for your video problems, you
are invited to test :)
 

	maybe we can join efforts to write something ?


I would sure be interested in the solution, but I don't know much about
computing, I just started python this year. I actually just copied what
is done in the pil_photoimage.py file.

I think I understand the idea behind weave, it is supposed to accelerate
the &quot;code&quot;, I can't help with that high level thing.

Another solution is to go on with the &quot;buffer format&quot; like in the
pink_to_ndimage function I wrote, but I don't know how to transform a
NDimage into a buffer nor how to read a buffer with pink. If someone has
an idea?

Jerome

	Hi,
	
	I don't have time to test your weave, but i already filed a
feature request about that:
	
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?func=detailfeature&amp;feature_id=5360&amp;">http://developer.berlios.de/feature/?func=detailfeature&amp;feature_id=5360&amp;</A>
group_id=12429
	
	with something done about it, but not much:
	
	def pink_to_ndimage(image):
	    if type(image) == pink.char_image:
	        return
	
scipy.frombuffer(image.get_pixels(),'int8').reshape(image.size[1],image.
size[0])
	    elif type(image) == pink.float_image:
	        return
	
scipy.frombuffer(image.get_pixels(),'float32').reshape(image.size[1],ima
ge.size[0])
	    elif type(image) == pink.int_image:
	        return
	
scipy.frombuffer(image.get_pixels(),'int32').reshape(image.size[1],image
.size[0])
	    else :
	        print(&quot;format non-detecte&quot;)

		Hello,
		
		I'm new to pink. I got my images as numpy arrays
(because I'm extracting
		them from videos, and then doing some pre-processing on
open cv and
		scipy-numpy), and would like an efficient way to convert
this numpy
		arrays to pink char images. Laszlo already pointed me at
a solution that
		works, using for loops in python, but it's a bit slow.
Does anyone have
		a solution? Would it be possible to implement such a
feature in pink. If
		yes, the way back to numpy would be necessary as well.
		
		I was trying also to write it using scipy.weave, but for
some reason it
		fails, any suggestion?
		My code looks like this:
		
		
		#bwtest is the binary image I would like to convert to
pink. Size_x and
		size_y are the x and y dimensions of bwtest.
		
		I=pink.cpp.char_image([size_x,size_y])
		
		code = '''
		       int i;
		       int m;
		
		       for (i=0; i &lt;size_x; ++i){
		           for (m=0; m&lt;size_y;++m){
		
		                I(i,m) = bwtest(m,i);
		            }
		       }
		       '''
		
		err = weave.inline(code,
arg_names=['size_x','size_y','bwtest','I'],
	
type_converters=weave.converters.blitz,
		                  compiler = 'gcc')
		
		Many thanks!
