<PRE>Dear Pink Users!

Berlios has announced that it would cease it's services on 2011-12-31. Berlios 
hosts our mailing list and the bug-tracker (which is of less interest as 
nobody's using it at the moment). It would also host the mercurial repository 
which we had wanted to switch to. We are once again in a seek of a project 
management system. 

Here are the proposed constraints (there are discussable):

We would like to have a public mercurial repository. Anyone should be able to 
pull the repository. 

We would like to have a mailing list where anybody can send messages without 
inscription. (The non subscribed users may require authorization).

We would like to have a bug-tracker, where anyone can post a bug (even if it's 
idle at the moment it can become useful some time). It would be good if users 
could send bug reports without a subscription.

In any case the subscription can ONLY enforce an email address as requirement 
(no phone number, no bank card id, no gmail account, no yahoo account,  etc.)

We would prefer free services but paid subscriptions are also to consider 
(free as in free speech not free beer). 

If You have suggestions or experiences please share them with the rest of the 
mailing list owners.

sincerely Yours,
