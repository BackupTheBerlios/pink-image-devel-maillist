<PRE>(from my phone)

From what I have seen the numpy array structure consists of linear contiguous buffers that can be &quot;reshaped&quot; to arbitrary dimensions. This seems compatible with the way things are arranged in the pink structure. Indeed right now the conversion between pink and numpy either way does a simple memcpy. For most operators reusing a pointer should be doable (no copy).

We should not need to use the numpy matrix structure which is indeed optimized for linear algebra.

&gt;<i> This is certainly a good idea. Based on what I have seen it can be reasonably

</I>&gt;<i> 1) Numpy is using the traditional linalg memory representation. This means 
</I>&gt;<i> that You can have non continuous matrices if You want to work only with a 
</I>&gt;<i> window of the image. For example if you have a 100x100 image and You only want

</I>&gt;<i> particularly difficult it is alien to Pink. The strides (as they are called in 
</I>&gt;<i> linalg) cannot be adapted to Pink by the means we have today (We would need to 
</I>&gt;<i> check every operator and adapt most of them). We could work around this issue 
</I>&gt;<i> by mandating continuous matrices. This could however mean that we would need 
</I>&gt;<i> to make a continuous copy implicitely, before passing them to Pink.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The bridging of complex numbers has to be done separately, as Pink uses 
</I>&gt;<i> it's own struct now. Fortunately there are not many complex operators, so we 
</I>&gt;<i> could do that hopefully.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) There are some operators in Pink which are useful like IM[[x,y]]. I do not 
</I>&gt;<i> know what is Numpy's approach, but I think in the end we can write our own 
</I>&gt;<i> operators. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) I don't know how well Numpy adapts to 3D and 4D images. The traditional 
</I>&gt;<i> linalg tools work with matrices. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) I would need to check the memory management, particularly the smart 
</I>&gt;<i> pointers / reference counters as python does them. This would require some 
</I>&gt;<i> time, but it is feasible.
