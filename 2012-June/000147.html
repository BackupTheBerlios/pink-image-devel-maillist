<PRE>This is certainly a good idea. Based on what I have seen it can be reasonably 
easy, but it has a few drawbacks:

1) Numpy is using the traditional linalg memory representation. This means 
that You can have non continuous matrices if You want to work only with a 
window of the image. For example if you have a 100x100 image and You only want 
to work with 10x12 image starting at 40x80. While this representation is not 
particularly difficult it is alien to Pink. The strides (as they are called in 
linalg) cannot be adapted to Pink by the means we have today (We would need to 
check every operator and adapt most of them). We could work around this issue 
by mandating continuous matrices. This could however mean that we would need 
to make a continuous copy implicitely, before passing them to Pink.

2) The bridging of complex numbers has to be done separately, as Pink uses 
it's own struct now. Fortunately there are not many complex operators, so we 
could do that hopefully.

3) There are some operators in Pink which are useful like IM[[x,y]]. I do not 
know what is Numpy's approach, but I think in the end we can write our own 
operators. 

4) I don't know how well Numpy adapts to 3D and 4D images. The traditional 
linalg tools work with matrices. 

5) I would need to check the memory management, particularly the smart 
pointers / reference counters as python does them. This would require some 
time, but it is feasible.
