<PRE>I am an occasional pink user, and I have to say one of the main reasons why I only use it occasionally, it's because (until very recently) lack of integration with numpy/scipy, which is really the standard for numerical analysis in python. Right now I think that there are not many (any?) good image processing library available for python, not as good as pink at least, which makes pink potentially interesting for a wide public ... if it would be fully compatible with numpy. Therefore, Hugh's proposal, for me as an external user - not involved in developing - look as step definitely should be taken. Of course, I have no idea how a big effort would it be to do such a thing, I hope it's possible, and that we would see a fully numpy compatible version of pink soon!

Subject: [Pink-image-devel] Proposal for arithmetics in pink

Hello all,

So given the previous email, I think it would require lots of efforts to duplicate numpy-like arithmetics under pink. Yet this kind of arithmetics is extremely useful. This is only one example, there are many other toolkits that are image-related under python, and almost without exception they use numpy as their basis.

Given the current work that Laszlo is doing for pink &lt;-&gt; numpy conversion, how much effort, or overhead, would it be for *all* pink function to accept a numpy array as imput instead of our current &quot;proprietary&quot; image format ? Also, if a pink image is given only numpy arrays as input, can it transparently output a numpy array instead of a pink image ?

This would allow us to leverage all the enormous effort put into numpy/scipy/scikit by other groups, and would likely make pink much much more popular and useful.

What do people think ?
