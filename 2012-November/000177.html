<PRE>Hello,

Once again things have changed with Boost without any warning. 

In boost version 1.51, the library libboost_system *must* now be specified to compile with the boost thread library.

As a result, the Pink cmake test concerning libboot_thread fails every time.

In the log file, I have

&gt;<i> /usr/bin/c++    -I/opt/local/include    -Wl,-search_paths_first -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names  -L/opt/local/lib CMakeFiles/cmTryCompileExec3728070013.dir/CheckIncludeFile.cxx.o  -o cmTryCompileExec3728070013  
</I>&gt;<i> Undefined symbols:
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;boost::system::system_category()&quot;, referenced from:
</I>&gt;<i>       __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)in CheckIncludeFile.cxx.o
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;boost::system::generic_category()&quot;, referenced from:
</I>&gt;<i>       __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)in CheckIncludeFile.cxx.o
</I>&gt;<i>       __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)in CheckIncludeFile.cxx.o
</I>&gt;<i> ld: symbol(s) not found
</I>&gt;<i> collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
</I>&gt;<i> make[1]: *** [cmTryCompileExec3728070013] Error 1
</I>

Now I've been trying for several hours to add this library to the compilation line using the cmake system.

I have ascertained that adding -lboost_system to the above compilation test does indeed work.

However there is no obvious way to add this requirement in the current system. I have tried the following:

- adding -lboost_system to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS, CMAKE_C_FLAGS and CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS

	result: nothing. These variables are completely ignored by the test 

- adding -lboost_sysytem to PYTHON_LIBRARY

	result: this allows the test to go through, however the library compilation stops later because this variable is no longer recognized as a library name

- adding the correct flags to UJ_CheckIncludeFileCXX.cmake

	result: screaming and hair being pulled off. This file is undocumented and so are the functions that it uses. I honestly cannot follow what it does. In particular this line:

    TRY_COMPILE(${VARIABLE}
      ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}
      ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}${CMAKE_FILES_DIRECTORY}/CMakeTmp/CheckIncludeFile.cxx
      COMPILE_DEFINITIONS ${CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS}
      CMAKE_FLAGS 
      -DCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS:STRING=${MACRO_CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_FLAGS}
      &quot;${CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX_INCLUDE_DIRS}&quot;
      OUTPUT_VARIABLE OUTPUT) 


	I cannot find anywhere the syntax for TRY_COMPILE ; 

	the line  -DCOMPILE_DEFINITIONS:STRING=${MACRO_CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_FLAGS} 

	is totally bizarre. I have managed to add all the libraries I need to MACRO_CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_FLAGS, however only the *first item* is recognized. Why ??

I'm open to any suggestion.


I have for some time been dreading recompiling pink with cmake. Very often something breaks that can sometime take hours to fix. The combination with boost is definitely not pleasant.

I think seriously that we need to reconsider how pink is being built at the moment, this is definitely not something for the amateur, and when Laszlo is no longer in a position to maintain it, I fear we will have to refactor everything. A lot of effort will have been wasted.

This is compounded by the fact that on OS/X the only serious way to get boost is through the  macport system ; however it is &quot;upgraded&quot; constantly and so we have to cope with these shenanigans all the time.

One suggestion by Laurent Najman is to ditch Boost completely for the Pink/Python interface, and go with SWIG, which would have the definite advantages of not strictly requiring C++ and providing bindings to other languages as well. For instance it would be very useful to bind Pink to Java, and from there to ImageJ.

This is a major undertaking, what do people think ? Am I the only one having problems with the current build system ?

Thanks.
