<PRE>Dear Pink Developers and Users,

as I have announced in an earlier email, the BerliOs project hosting is coming 
to an end this months. We have been occupied in the past months with the 
future of Pink's hosting.

The candidate for new project hosting is Redmine. We invite all the 
participants of the list to make remarks or suggestions concerning the project 
hosting and Redmine in particular. We would welcome suggestions for other 
project management software as well. The server will be a debian 6. with only 
the packages included in the official repository.  

We would like to choose a durable solution as moving the mailing lists, the 
bug-tracker and the repository takes lots of effort and it also cuts our 
rankings in search engines not speaking about the difficulties it causes the 
developers to learn a new forge system. 

We have considered other project hosting services from which Google Project 
Hosting have seemed the most durable. Unfortunately after repeated experiments 
with Google Project Hosting, we have deduced that Google indeed demands a 
phone number for the account registration from some users. This is 
inconceivable and would hold back the progress of the project. 

In the end we have decided to set up an own forge system which will be kindly 
hosted on the servers of ESIEE Engineering. We will set up the server in such 
manner that even if the hosting will need to move, all the virtual server will 
remain intact. 

We hope to bring several benefits to the developers and the potential users:
1) We move the source management to an open mercurial repository from which 
all the commits will be available instantly
2) After a simple registration without any proof of identity, everybody will 
be able to submit bugs, feature requests, etc.
3) We are giving push access to developers who want to participate actively. 

From those who have pending issues, like pylab, scipy integration, broken 
compilation, etc. I kindly ask for a little more patience. 

cordially, 

Laszlo Marak

</PRE>
