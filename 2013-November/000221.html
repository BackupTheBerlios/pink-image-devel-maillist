Hi everybody,

from a colleague I heard that building Pink makes problems. In fact, using makeli64 on my Mac stopped building pgm2GA and diZenzo. Both programs claimed definitions of lderiche3d not in the makefile! Commenting both in general.make let at least finish the build.

After this partial success I continued:
Occasionally I tried to build Pink with cmake on my Mac (OS X 10.8.5), up to today always without success. Still today, after a new effort it looks much better than ever before.

First:
Some additions in the library and include definition part of the CMakeLists.txt (I am using MacPorts located in /opt/local and X11 in /opt/X11) had also to be reflected in the default include file search path (CPATH) of the compiler (I have Xcode 5 installed).

Second
There are some files trying to include malloc.h not existent on Mac: ldilutbin3d, lprofile, mcscene. I replaced the include directive by

#if !defined (__APPLE__)
#include &lt;malloc.h&gt;
#endif

Third besides lots of warnings (Xcode 5 installs clang as the standard compiler) there was one error

In file included from /.../pink_v/pink/src/lib/liar_fseries.cxx:54:
In file included from /.../pink_v/pink/include/pink.h:323:
/.../pink_v/pink/include/uiSqhool.hpp:195:17: error: default arguments cannot be added to a function template that has already been declared
                                std::string full_path=&quot;&quot;

I deleted in uiSqhool.hpp:195 the default argument =&quot;&quot; .

Forth I switched over to gcc-apple-4.2 from MacPorts. This reduced considerably the number of warnings.

Fifth I have still problems with the built of several modules most probably resulting from link problems of liar_line and liar_fseries concerning missing references in boost!

Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  &quot;boost::system::system_category()&quot;, referenced from:
      __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)in liar_fseries.cxx.o
      __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)in liar_line.cxx.o
  &quot;boost::system::generic_category()&quot;, referenced from:
      __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)in liar_fseries.cxx.o
      __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)in liar_line.cxx.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64

I don't know if only I have all these problems with cmake of pink. I would appreciate to hear from other (Mac-)Users about their experiences. Up to now I have only tried the bash_front_end to build. I don't know when I am encouraged enough to start with the python_front_end.

Karsten
