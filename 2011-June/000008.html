<PRE>I have made a massive code reorganization in the python wrapper. Before the 
compilation could be finished, each function has to be wrapped to the Python 
front end.  As the compilation must be done before the Python interpreter 
would be launched, every function must be compiled with every known image 
type. 

Until now, there was only one wrapper file (pypink.cpp), so the end of the 
compilation was delayed by this single file. I have split up pypink.cpp into 
five equal pieces and several other small files. This increased the parallel 
compilation time. Pink can be compiled in parallel with 
make -j16
where 16 is the number of threads used for the compilation. Here are the 
benchmarks:
r484 with -O0  2min 30sec
r485 with -O0  47 sec

r484 release 3 min 10 sec
r485 release 1 min 35 sec

Remember, that these times only improve this much on a massively multicore 
machine. 

Furthermore I have decreased the dependencies to minimal. Before r484 the 
Python wrapper contained a single header file, with all Pink's declarations. 
If any of the header files have changed, every wrapper file had to be 
recompiled. From r485 onwards, only the header files specifically necessary 
are included in each wrapper file. This means if You change a header file, 
CMake recompiles only those specific wrapper files, which get hit. This should 
decrease the compilation time during the development. 

As a different issue, Pink did not have conversion functions for short images. 
I have added the complete spectrum, but I have not tested yet, so there may be 
some bugs left.
