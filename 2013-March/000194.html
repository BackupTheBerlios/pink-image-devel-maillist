<PRE>Hello,

I am trying to perform watershed analysis on a 3D system - particularly 
to take a binary image (that is, a solid-phase and a pore-phase) and 
perform watershed on the distance-from-the-solid-phase function in the 
pore-phase. I believe this is a common use of watershed. I have the 
system as a geometrical input, and I already have python (and cython) 
code to initialise a numpy (or custom C) buffer as a binary voxel image, 
and compute the distance function**.

I have now got pink installed and working as a python module (a few 
months ago I tried and failed because of dependency problems on Mac OS X 
- I'm now running in a Debian virtual machine and everything is much 
easier!) but I'm finding that the documentation assumes I know what 
pink thinks an image looks like, what a binary image output would 
represent, and so on.

Is there documentation somewhere (not necessarily specific to the 
watershed parts of the library) which explains the high-level concepts 
of the library/what the abbreviations in the docstrings mean, has an 
example / unit test for each function, and an explanation of the way 
python types are interpreted in the C/C++ implementations? If this 
exists, it would enable me to make significant progress without 
bothering this mailing list too much in the future :)

Thanks very much,

Joe

** The reason I have all this code already: I attempted to implement my 
own watershed algorithm, but beyond initialising the image with a 
distance function, and obtaining the entity centres (which I think pink 
calls 'markers') I have got stuck about how to implement entity 
partitioning - my quick, naive algorithm gives awful results, and my 
ideas for a cleverer one would be very computationally expensive.
